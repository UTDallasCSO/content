_While these materials have been targeted for workshops, they can certainly be used for self-paced learning from your home as well. Just that it can be more enjoyable experience if you have at least a partner to discuss and exchange ideas! Some background in programming concepts will enable you to enjoy the material – so I recommend you to complete Alice workshop first._
