### Day 3

Assignment | Topic | Materials
---- | ---- | ----
1: | Draw a nice house! | Documentation: Click on Documentation or click here www.khanacademy.org/cs/docs  & processingjs.org/reference. Each API comes with a sample usage too.
| Goto https://www.khanacademy.org/cs/programming: Review all the tutorials listed under Coloring Video: Draw a ellipse with random size & random color! Documentation: [random()](http://www.khanacademy.org/cs/randomlow-high/827911487) | `noStroke(); fill(random(0,255),random(0,255), random(0,255)); ellipse(random(0,400), random(0,400), random(0,100), random(0,100));`
| You can comment out individual lines with // and multiple lines with /* ... */
| Also, what happens if these lines are out of order? Try it! |
| How to restrict to circles? See the power of variable! | `noStroke(); fill(random(0,255),random(0,255), random(0,255)); var diameter = random(0,100); ellipse(random(0,400), random(0,400), diameter, diameter);`
| Alternate way to draw the circle! | `stroke(random(0,255),random(0,255), random(0,255));strokeWeight(random(0,100)); point(random(0,400), random(0,400));`
2: | Add a random square! Unlike ellipse(), x and y parameters in rect() indicate the top, left corner. |
| make the circle appear fully inside the canvas area. In other words, we want to ensure that the circles are never cut off at the edges. Idea is to push the circle in if it is too close to the boundaries. Realize the power of IF statements! | `noStroke(); fill(random(0,255),random(0,255), random(0,255)); var dia = random(0,200); var x = random(0,400);  var y = random(0,400); var rad = dia / 2; if (x < rad) {x = rad;} if (x > 400 - rad) { x = 400 - rad;} if (y < rad) { y = rad; }if (y > 400 - rad) {y = 400 - rad;} ellipse(x, y, dia, dia);`
| Extra: What are the code changes if you want to do the same for ellipses? Alternate approach: Both Software Engineering perfectionists and Mathematicians make like the following one better! Why? | `noStroke(); fill(random(0,255),random(0,255), random(0,255)); var dia = random(0,200); var rad = dia / 2; var x = random(rad,400-rad); var y = random(rad,400-rad); ellipse(x, y, dia, dia);`
3: | Make your square to appear within the canvas area too – let us go one step further – let us avoid the edges all-together – make the squares appear within the rectangular area of (10,10) to (390,390). Extra: What if we want to do the same for any rectangle?
| For loops: Video: Draw 10 random circles! | `for(var i=0 ; i<10 ; i++) {stroke(random(0,255),random(0,255), random(0,255)); strokeWeight(random(0,100)); point(random(0,400), random(0,400)); }` Now, click near 10 and drag the mouse left or right. What happens?
4: | Draw 10 concentric randomly colored circles. What does “concentric” mean?
 | Will you draw in the order of small to large circles, or other way around? Extra: Define a variable n at the top and write the generic code to draw n concentric circles instead. var n=10;... Change n by clicking near 10 and dragging mouse left or right. Does your code work properly? | ![concentric circles](http://www.utdallas.edu/~veerasam/kajs/index_files/image014.jpg)
 | With random colors: `noStroke(); for (var i = 10; i > 0; i--) {fill(random(0,255),random(0,255), random(0,255)); ellipse(200, 200, i * 20, i * 40); ellipse(200, 200, i * 40, i * 20); }` With a color pattern: `noStroke(); for (var i = 10; i > 0; i--) {fill(i*25,50,(10-i)*25); ellipse(200, 200, i * 20, i * 40); ellipse(200, 200, i * 40, i * 20); }` | ![pattern1](http://www.utdallas.edu/~veerasam/kajs/index_files/image016.jpg) ![pattern2](http://www.utdallas.edu/~veerasam/kajs/index_files/image018.jpg)
  5. | Assignment 5: Adjust the color pattern to use a loop of 20, then change the color pattern such that Green color appears in the middle as shown in the image. Extra: Can you make it perfect Green in the middle? | ![pattern3](http://www.utdallas.edu/~veerasam/kajs/index_files/image020.jpg)
  6. | With n specified at the top, how will you generate n x n equally distributed circles? Keep 50 as the default diameter size for circles, but reduce as needed to avoid overlapping with other circles. Take it easy & draw just one line of n equally distributed circles first, then expand it to n x n circles. Extra: How to draw circles in diamond formation? Middle row should have n circles, adjacent rows should have (n-2) circles, their adjacent rows should have (n-4) circles, so on. Top and bottom rows should have only 1 or 2 circles in the middle | ![iamge1](http://www.utdallas.edu/~veerasam/kajs/index_files/image022.jpg) ![image2](http://www.utdallas.edu/~veerasam/kajs/index_files/image024.jpg) ![image3](http://www.utdallas.edu/~veerasam/kajs/index_files/image026.jpg)
