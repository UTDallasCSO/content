# content
__Curated content for all tools and languages and camps taught under the auspices of the CS Outreach programs. You can conduct camps upto a week-long using just the material in this repo for the subject assigned to you.__

###The whole idea is...
----
...to have a body of content ready for you, the CS Outreach instructors so that:
  * all participants can have a similar experience
  * you don't waste any time preparing content everytime you are assigned to a new tool, language or camp.
  * you can solely focus on the teaching part and not worry about content creation and know what you have to cover for a given camp or session so that you can pace yourself.

You are welcome to submit pull requests for corrections, enhancements, addition and modification of any of the content.
