##[Virtual hands-on workshop : “Enjoyable Introduction to Programming using  Alice”](http://www.utdallas.edu/~veerasam/alice/virutal_workshop.docx)

by Dr. Jeyakesavan Veerasamy, CS faculty, University of Texas at Dallas, USA.
 
While these materials have been targeted for workshops, they can be used for self-paced learning from your home as well. Just that it can be more enjoyable experience if you have at least one partner to discuss and exchange ideas! This material does not assume any prior experience in programming & it is really meant for absolute beginners! Jump in and enjoy.
 
Welcome the participants to Alice workshop with this video (turn ON the speakers first):

P1 | Alice installation and lab setup - 1 week prior to workshop, download Alice 2.3 software from www.alice.org and unzip and store in each computer. See the PPT for more details. | [PPT](http://www.utdallas.edu/~veerasam/alice/aliceprep.pptx)
0 | Why does it make sense to use Alice first? (Why not learn C/C++/Java directly?) | [PPT](http://www.utdallas.edu/~veerasam/alice/why_alice_first.pptx) 
1 | Welcome to Alice workshop! Here are a few suggestions to get the maximum value from this workshop. We will cycle through 3 modes for each topic/example: Watching, Doing it individually, helping each other to complete and work on something extra. You can use http://www.online-stopwatch.com/ to make sure that the workshop is progressing in timely manner.

7b | Do at least one exercise from the following list. Work on all of them if time permits:<ul><li>Exercise 1: Add cow and chicken to a new world and make them greet each other by bowing, then go back to normal position. Repeat it using a loop.<li>Exercise 2: Add two animals like Dog and Cat. Make the dominant animal approach the other one. Now, make the 2nd animal grow in size and scare the first animal. 1st animal should turn and run away. Repeat it using a loop.<li>Exercise 3: Add two people, make them face each other, place a ball in-between them and try to simulate kicking the ball back & forth.</ul> | | 15 minutes
