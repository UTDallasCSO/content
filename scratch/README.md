####What is Scratch?
Scratch is a visual programming environment where you design/create your interactive stories, games & animations. While Scrtach has been designed with a typical 3rd or 4th grader in mind, people of all ages can use it to learn the basics of programming in an enjoyable way! Scratch involves drag and drop of various blocks together to write programs & such an environment enables the users to focus on the logic & enjoy the learning experience! Unlike most Java/C++ development environments, there is NO free-form typing, so there are syntax errors either! Scratch is not limted to young people though - people of all ages with no programming experience can enjoy its simplicity and learn the basics of programming!

####Getting Started!
We use web based application development interface for Scratch Programming:
* Home: http://scratch.mit.edu/
* Create New: http://scratch.mit.edu/projects/editor/?tip_bar=getStarted
 
1. Each object in Scratch is called a sprite. Default sprite is a cat.
2. The background for the sprite is called Stage OR backdrop.
3. Scripts can be dragged and placed/appended on to the grey workspace (towards right). Each group of scripts is run upon double-clicking the first block of script OR by triggering the event.
4. New sprites and backdrops can be added. Each sprite and backdrop is associated with respective sequence of scripts.
